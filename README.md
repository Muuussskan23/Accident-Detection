# ðŸš¦ AI-Powered Real-Time Accident Detection

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered accident detection system developed using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLOv4**.  
It processes live video streams from a connected webcam to detect collisions between vehicles or people.  

While the current implementation uses a webcam, it can be integrated with CCTV or IP camera feeds, making it suitable for **smart city surveillance** and **road safety monitoring**.  

Upon detecting an accident:
1. An alarm sound is played.
2. (Optional) An instant alert is sent via **Twilio** to notify emergency contacts.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection** â€” Monitors live video feeds for accident events.
- **YOLOv4 Object Recognition** â€” Detects vehicles and pedestrians accurately.
- **Collision Analysis** â€” Uses bounding box proximity to determine possible accidents.
- **Instant Alerts** â€” Audible alarm and optional phone call via Twilio API.
- **Flexible Input** â€” Works with CCTV footage, webcam streams, or video files.
- **Cross-Platform** â€” Runs locally or on cloud platforms (e.g., Google Colab).

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

â”‚â”€â”€ main.py                # Main script to capture video and detect accidents  
â”‚â”€â”€ yolov4.cfg             # YOLOv4 configuration file  
â”‚â”€â”€ yolov4.weights         # YOLOv4 pretrained weights  
â”‚â”€â”€ coco.names             # Object class labels  
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Twilio (for phone alerts)
- YOLOv4 model files (coco.names`)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy twilio
```
**â–¶ How to Run**

**Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/Muuussskan23/Accident-Detection.git
cd Accident-Detection

**Download YOLOv4 model files**

Place yolov4.cfg, yolov4.weights, and coco.names in the project directory.

**Run the script**

python main.py

**or in Google Colab:**

!python main.py

**Set Environment Variables**

Before running the script, set your Twilio credentials and alert phone number:

```bash
export TWILIO_SID="your_sid"
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
export ALERT_PHONE="your_phone_number"
```

**How It Works**

1. Captures live frames from a connected camera.  
2. Detects vehicles and people (via image processing or YOLOv4).  
3. Checks overlap between bounding boxesâ€”if above threshold, it considers it an accident.  
4. On Detection:  
   - Plays alarm  
   - Optionally initiates a phone call via Twilio.  
5. Provides live visual feedback with detection boxes.
